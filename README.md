### Hi ðŸ‘‹, 
I'm Richard, a Data Scientist and life-long learner with vast interest and experience in building innovative "user-focused" solutions using tools such as data science, machine learning, IoT, and embedded systems. 

Over the past 3 years, I have led and collaborated with geographically distributed and culturally diverse teams in using data to solve challenging problems across a wide range of industries including finance, healthcare and education. 

Additionally, I am passionate about communities & education so you might often find me speaking at conferences, participating in local/virtual tech meetups, providing mentorship services, and facilitating initiatives at a couple of tech communities.
